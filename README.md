snode
=====

A small web framework written in python using dependency injection technology.

This is mainly a rewrite of my previous seminode project.


Quickstart
----------

For bootstrapping snode uses buildout. Just execute the following commands and you get a working instance.

* git co https://github.com/refnode/snode.git
* cd snode
* make

As a workaround for outdated setuptools, execute the following commands on debian based distributions:

* sudo apt-get install python-pip
* sudo pip install -U distribute
